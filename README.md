## HTML2Slim

Script for converting HTML and ERB files to slim (slim-lang.org).

It's not perfect, but certainly it helps a lot!

It's based on Hpricot. Yeah, I'm old school.

## Installation

Install HTML2Slim as a gem:

```
$ gem install html2slim
```

## Usage

You may convert files using the included executables `html2slim` and `erb2slim`.

    # html2slim -h

    Usage: html2slim INPUT_FILENAME_OR_DIRECTORY [OUTPUT_FILENAME_OR_DIRECTORY] [options]
            --trace                      Show a full traceback on error
        -d, --delete                     Delete HTML files
        -h, --help                       Show this message
        -v, --version                    Print version

    # erb2slim -h

    Usage: erb2slim INPUT_FILENAME_OR_DIRECTORY [OUTPUT_FILENAME_OR_DIRECTORY] [options]
            --trace                      Show a full traceback on error
        -d, --delete                     Delete ERB files
        -h, --help                       Show this message
        -v, --version                    Print version

Alternatively, to convert files or strings on the fly in your application, you may do so by calling `HTML2Slim.convert!(file, format)` where format is either :html or :erb.

## ROADMAP

1. ERB support is beta, and works only for ~92.6% of the cases. Lotsa weird regexes. Gotta improve that.
2. Use temple.
3. Merge with other *2slim gems. Would be handy.
